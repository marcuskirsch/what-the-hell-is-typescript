# What the hell is TypeScript?

---

- released for public use in October 2012
- developed by Microsoft
- completely open sourced on GitHub
- subset of JavaScript
- transpiled to JavaScript

---

## TypeScript vs. JavaScript

---

- static vs dynamic typings
  - static typing allows developers to detect the bugs as writing the scripts
- object-oriented concepts (Interface, Modules, Generics, Classes)

---

## Why TypeScript?

---

- for large codebase, the overall performance of Typescript is far better than Javascript and ES6
- it offers better productivity and maintainability for developers
- integration with IDE VS Code provides better code navigation and catching bugs before compilation

---

- static typing, object-oriented concepts and additional features over ES6 help the developer to understand the problems in real time
- code easier to understand, increase the performance

---

## Why not flow?


```
HR: Hi, we use X, Y, Z, and Flow for this project
Dev: Flow? Why not TypeScript?
HR: Oh, are kidding me? :facepalm:
```

---

- types are mostly shipped with the package
- unfixed bugs (e.g. cannot annotate `this` - typing is lost there)
- Plugins for IDE's are buggy and unreliable for flow
- first-class TypeScript support for VSCode (intellisense, type-checking, and autocomplete out of the box)

---

## Code Example

```
console.log('Hello TypeScript');
```
